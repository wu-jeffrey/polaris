Created for my MTE 380 Project, the goal of which was to explore a novel way to help blind and visually impaired people navigate public spaces. These LED glasses leverages the partial vision posessed by 86% of BVI individuals to guide them in an intuitive way that is easier to learn that white canes and much less expensive than guide dogs. Note that this device doesn't have functions for object detection or path planning. Instead, the idea is to use technologies from the self-driving and autonomous vehicle space as they mature; using different sensors and pathing algorithms to direct BVI individuals instead of vehicles.
